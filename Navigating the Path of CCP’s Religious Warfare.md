The Paradox of Xi Jinping’s “Sinicization of Religion”

In 2016, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader Xi Jinping introduced the concept of “sinicization of religion” in a speech. This notion seemingly catered to an instinctive inclination that had existed in Chinese society for over a century, yet it inadvertently reflected a longstanding paradox that the CCP has been unable to eliminate since seizing power in 1949.

Instinctively, many Chinese people perceive their major religious beliefs as foreign imports: Buddhism came from India and Tibet, Islam arrived via trade and migration routes from the Middle East, and another branch of the Abrahamic religions, Christianity, arrived overseas from Europe and the Americas. To CCP leaders and many Han Chinese, these faiths represent “foreign influences” that could potentially disrupt social stability.

However, the contradiction lies in the fact that Marxism itself is also an import, imposed on Chinese society through what former CCP leader Mao Zedong famously referred to as the “barrel of a gun.” Marxism not only subverted China’s existing social structures and spiritual beliefs but, after evolving into Mao Zedong Thought, it became a de facto state religion with Mao as its “savior.”

This was not accidental. “We must worship everything correct from Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, worship them forever; if we don’t worship, we’ll be done for,” Mao declared at a party congress in 1958, asserting that “the truth lies in their hands.” In 1970, this so-called “Great Helmsman” told the American journalist Edgar Snow, who consistently defended him, that personal worship was a strategy necessary to “overcome the traditional habits of worshiping emperors for 3,000 years.”

However, during Mao’s “Long March” that ultimately led to his seizing power, the burgeoning faith in China was not in traditional Chinese religions but in Christianity. This faith rose in China under the influence of modernists educated in the West who helped overthrow the Qing Dynasty in the early 20th century.

Nevertheless, most Chinese people did not welcome this new phenomenon. There was a saying circulating among the Han Chinese at the time: “One more Christian means one less Chinese.”

Therefore, Xi Jinping’s call for the “sinicization” of religion finds its historical basis in this context. It is both a gesture to cater to nationalist sentiments and, undoubtedly, driven by self-interest. In December 2021, at a religious conference in Beijing, Xi Jinping stated, “We must improve the system of democratic supervision of the leadership team members and comprehensively promote the rule of law in religious work.”

Under the Orwellian guise of “democracy,” Xi Jinping’s statement reveals the true motive behind his “sinicization” efforts: tighter control over the populace. While “supervision” may sound benign, Xi’s version of it translates into strict control over the Catholic Church, further suppression of Protestantism, continued harsh treatment of Tibetan Buddhists, and ruthless repression of Uighur Muslims and Falun Gong practitioners.

As early as 1939, Mao Zedong condemned Christian missionaries as “agents of imperialist powers” sent to “poison the minds of the Chinese people.” In 1949, during a meeting with a Soviet official, Mao intensified his attacks, insinuating that missionary activities were a “blemish” on China that needed to be “swept away” and “cleansed.” He labeled American missionary work in China and charitable activities as “spiritual aggression.” Five years later, during a meeting with the Dalai Lama, Mao whispered that religion was “poison,” citing Tibet and Mongolia as examples.

Xi Jinping’s criticisms of religious freedom mirror Mao Zedong’s rhetoric. “We must resolutely resist the penetration of foreign forces using religion,” Xi Jinping stated in April 2016 at the National Religious Work Conference. Ironically, communism itself was imported from Germany and Russia, not indigenous to China. Yet, Mao’s indifference to rationalizing this issue is echoed by Xi Jinping.

Regardless, after 1949, the CCP government imposed atheistic ideology on the Chinese people and emphasized its necessity by closing churches, mosques, and temples on a massive scale, destroying religious symbols, forcing Catholic priests and nuns to marry, and imprisoning thousands of clergy and religious leaders in labor camps. In Tibet alone, approximately 6,000 monasteries were destroyed, and countless Buddhist monks and nuns were arrested and killed. In 1966, with the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution, this terror campaign intensified, leading to convictions and possible arrests and executions for possessing religious books, among other offenses. Many Catholic priests and bishops faced similar fates.

Meanwhile, the Chinese people were compelled to read and memorize the “New Bible,” officially known as “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” but colloquially referred to as the “Little Red Book.” Approximately 800 million copies were printed, equivalent to one for every adult in the country. The book contained outdated revolutionary slogans, such as “Every Communist must grasp the truth: Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,” along with content that deified Mao Zedong as a savior.

After Mao Zedong’s death and the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people finally found relief but fell into confusion. “Mao became a living deity, but the problem was, he died,” wrote Ian Johnson. “When Mao died in 1976, the country was shocked… With traditional religion (mostly) destroyed and Mao dead, where could people turn for faith?”

Deng Xiaoping, after imprisoning Mao’s widow (Jiang Qing) and other members of the “Gang of Four,” adopted a more moderate policy toward the people, stabilizing society and calming hearts. One of Deng Xiaoping’s policies was to relax control over religious organizations and believers, effectively soothing the emotions of the Chinese people.

However, the current “strongman” of China, Xi Jinping, has not learned from Deng Xiaoping’s lessons. In the 21st century, Xi Jinping’s regime has launched a renewed crackdown on all religions. Xi Jinping demands that Communist Party members be “firm Marxists and atheists” to achieve his goal of “sinicization,” which entails integrating all independent groups into the CCP’s “machine,” ensuring their complete obedience to party rule and ideology. In December 2021, senior CCP officials attended the National Religious Work Conference in Beijing. Subsequently, some government agencies introduced new legal measures to strengthen restrictions on clergy, church schools, and religious content online.

Recently, major media outlets around the world have extensively reported on the detention of over a million Uighurs in re-education camps, which Beijing euphemistically refers to as “re-education centers.”

Simultaneously, the Xi Jinping regime continues to persecute Falun Gong practitioners and Tibetan Buddhists and has intensified its crackdown on Christians, such as demolishing crosses and Jesus portraits in churches that do not comply with government mandates and arresting members of underground churches.

In Hong Kong, the local government, following Beijing’s orders, arrested and prosecuted the respected retired bishop Joseph Zen last year. In 2019, millions of Hong Kong residents took to the streets to protest against the extradition law, which would allow the CCP authorities to arbitrarily arrest dissenters in Hong Kong and extradite them to mainland China for trial. This law became known as the “Extradition Bill,” and Bishop Joseph Zen and other prominent Catholic and Protestant leaders openly supported the protests.

In recent years, the United States and some international institutions have shown a stronger willingness to confront the CCP’s religious warfare. The widespread condemnation of the CCP’s massive persecution of Uighurs has been echoed worldwide. In 2021, both the Trump and Biden administrations formally classified the CCP’s actions in Xinjiang as “genocide.”

The above determinations were to some extent based on a report published by Adrian Zenz, a researcher at the Jamestown Foundation, in 2020. In the report, Zenz pointed out that the sharp decline in the Uighur population growth rate in recent years confirmed testimonies about the CCP’s forced sterilization and abortion of Muslim women.

The situation for Falun Gong practitioners is even worse. The CCP authorities claim the spiritual movement is a “cult” and have engaged in a brutal campaign of mass detention, torture, and even killing of Falun Gong practitioners for over two decades, sparing no effort to eradicate the group, employing horrifying methods.
